# **GE-MCM: Gene Expression Multifactorial Causal Model**
![GE-MCM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/647b1e43-be4c-4aea-95b7-82167703bf9b)


A multiscale mathematical model that concurrently accounts for the direct influence of hundreds of genes on regional macroscopic brain neuroimaging phenotypes, the pathological spreading of the ensuing aberrations across axonal and vascular networks, and the resultant effects of these alterations on clinical manifesttations.
